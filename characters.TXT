Jay Gatsby
Ambitious and idealistic, Gatsby is the epitome of the “self-made man.” He is a reticent young millionaire who rose from humble origins in the American Midwest to a position of prominence among the Long Island elite.

Nick Carraway
Nick Carraway is a recent Yale graduate who moves to Long Island after getting a job as a bond salesman. He is relatively innocent and mild-mannered, especially when compared to the hedonistic elite among whom he lives. 

Daisy Buchanan
Beautiful, frivolous, and rich, Daisy is a young socialite with no troubles to speak of—at least, that's how it seems on the surface. Daisy is self-absorbed, somewhat shallow, and a little vain, but she's also charming and high-spirited.

Tom Buchanan
Tom is the brutal, arrogant, and wealthy husband of Daisy. He is a deeply unlikeable character for reasons including his careless infidelity, possessive behavior, and barely-disguised white supremacist views. 

Jordan Baker
The ultimate party girl, Jordan is a professional golfer and the group’s resident cynic. She’s very much a woman in a man’s world, and her professional successes have been overshadowed by scandal in her personal life.
